# CSS

**Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like [HTML](/wiki/HTML).
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_wide_web), alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [Javascript](/wiki/Javascript).

The name *cascading* comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

###Why use CSS?
These are the three major benefuts of CSS:

1. **Solves a big problem : **Before CSS, tags like font, color, backgroung style etc. had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.

2. **Saves a lot of time : **CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.

3. **Provide more attributes : **CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain [HTML](/wiki/HTML) to define the look and feel of the website.

# CSS

**Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like [HTML](/wiki/HTML).
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_wide_web), alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [Javascript](/wiki/Javascript).

The name *cascading* comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

#### CSS Features
These are the three major benefits of CSS:

1. **CSS saves time :** You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple [HTML](/wiki/HTML) pages.

2. **Easy Maintainence :** To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.

3. **Search Engines :** CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.

4. **Superior styles to HTML :** CSS has a much wider array of attributes than [HTML](/wiki/HTML), so you can give a far better look to your [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page in comparison to [HTML](/wiki/HTML) attributes.

#### CSS Syntax

A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.

 ```
Selector => h1
Declaration => {color:blue;font size:12px;}
 ```

* The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
* The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
* Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
* For Example:
	* color is property and blue is value.
	* font size is property and 12px is value.
* A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

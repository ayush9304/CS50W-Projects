# World Wide Web

The **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb (**WWW**) commonly known as **the Web**, is an [information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system) where documents and other [web resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource) are identified by [Uniform Resource Locators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) (URLs, such as `https://example.com/`), which may be interlinked by [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext), and are accessible over the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). The resources of the Web are transferred via the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a [*web browser*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and are published by a software application called a [*web server*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server).

A broader definition comes from the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C):
>&emsp;***"The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge."***

[*Tim Berners-Lee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Timothy_John_Berners-Lee) is the inventor of the Web and the director of the W3C, the organization that oversees its development. [Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Timothy_John_Berners-Lee) developed hypertext, the method of instant cross-referencing that supports communications on the Web, making it easy to link content on one web page to content located elsewhere. The introduction of hypertext revolutionized the way people used the internet.

English engineer and computer scientist [Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Timothy_John_Berners-Lee) invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext media that have been formatted in [Hypertext Markup Language](/wiki/HTML) (HTML). Such formatting allows for embedded [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) that contain URLs and permit users to [navigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation) to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components which are displayed in the [user's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)) web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.

# Pythonidae

The **Pythonidae**, commonly known as pythons, are a [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) of [nonvenomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomous_snake) [snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake) found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Nine [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) and 40 [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) are currently recognized.

#### Distribution and habitat

Pythons are found in [sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka), [Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma), southern China, Southeast Asia, and from the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines) southeast through [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia) to [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea) and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia).

In the United States, an introduced population of [Burmese pythons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python), *Python bivittatus*, has existed as an [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species) in the [Everglades National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_National_Park) since the late 1990s.

#### Behavior
Most members of this family are [ambush predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_predator), in that they typically remain motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. Attacks on humans, although known to occur, are extremely rare.

#### Feeding
Pythons use their sharp, backward-curving teeth, four rows in the upper jaw, two in the lower, to grasp prey which is then killed by [constriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constriction); after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, the python quickly wraps a number of coils around it. Death occurs primarily by cardiac arrest.
Larger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a house cat, but larger food items are known; some large 

Asian species have been known to take down adult deer, and the African rock python, [Python *sebae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_sebae), has been known to eat [antelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope). In 2017, there was a recorded case of a [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) devoured by a python in [Sulawesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulawesi), [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia). All prey is swallowed whole, and may take several days or even weeks to fully digest.

# HTML
**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](/wiki/CSS) and scripting languages such as [JavaScript](/wiki/Javascript).[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) receive HTML documents from a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
[HTML elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element) are the building blocks of HTML pages. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets e.g., `<p>`.
HTML elements includes:
* headings
* paragraphs
* lists
* links
* and more!
The most recent major version of HTML is HTML5.Syntax for basic HTML file looks like: ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> 	<head> 		<title>Page Title</title> 	</head> 	<body> 		<h1>Heading</h1> 		<p>Paragraph</p> 	</body> </html> ```

# Python (genus)
Python is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of constricting snakes in the [Pythonidae](/wiki/Pythonidae) [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) native to the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics) and subtropics of the [Eastern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Hemisphere).
The name *Python* was proposed by [Francois Marie Daudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Marie_Daudin) in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Currently, 10 python [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) are recognized as valid [taxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxa).
#### Distribution and habitat
In [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), pythons are native to the tropics south of the [Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara), but not in the extreme south-western tip of southern Africa (Western Cape) or in [Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar). In [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia), they occur from [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan), and [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka), including the [Nicobar Islands](Nicobar_Islands), through [Myanmar](Myanmar), east to [Indochina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochina), southern [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) and [Hainan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan), as well as in the [Malayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) region of [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia) and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines).#### InvasiveSome suggest that *P. bivittatus* and *P. sebae* have the potential to be problematic invasive species in South Florida. In early 2016, after a culling operation yielded 106 pythons, [Everglades National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_National_Park) officials suggested that "thousands" may live within the park, and that the species has been breeding there for some years. More recent data suggest that these pythons would not withstand winter climates north of [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida), contradicting previous research suggesting a more significant geographic potential range.#### UsesPython skin is used to make clothing, such as vests, belts, boots and shoes, or fashion accessories such as handbags. It may also be stretched and formed as the sound board of some string musical instruments, such as the [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) spike-fiddle, [sanxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxian) and the [sanshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshin) lutes.#### As petsMany Python species, such as [*P. regius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_regius), [*P. brongersmai*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_brongersmai), [*P. bivittatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_bivittatus) and [*M. reticulatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayopython_reticulatus), are popular to keep as pets due to their ease of care, docile temperament, and vibrant colors, with some rare mutations having been sold for several thousands of dollars. Despite controversy that has arisen from media reports, with proper safety procedures pet pythons are relatively safe to own, and deaths associated with them are isolated compared to other domestic animals, such as [dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_lupus_familiaris) and [horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_ferus_caballus).

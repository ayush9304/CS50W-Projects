# Django

**Django** is a [Python](/wiki/Python)-based [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) web framework that follows the [model-template-view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-template-view) (MVC) architectural pattern.
It is maintained by [*Django Software Foundation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Software_Foundation) (DSF), an American independent organisation.

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes [reusability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability) and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of [don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative [create, read, update and delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

Some well known sites that use Django include [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS), [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram), [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation), [The Washington Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times), [Disqus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus), [Bitbucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket), and [Nextdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextdoor).

#### Some features of Django

* **Versatility of Django :** Django can build almost any type of website. It can also work with any client-side framework and can deliver content in any format such as [HTML](/wiki/HTML), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) etc. Some sites which can be built using Django are wikis, [social networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network), new sites etc.

* **Security :** Since Django framework is made for making web development easy, it has been engineered in such a way that it automatically do the right things to protect the website. For example, In the Django framework instead of putting a password in [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie), the hashed password is stored in it so that it can’t be fetched easily by [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker).

* **Scalability :** Django web nodes have no stored state, they scale horizontally – just fire up more of then when you need them. Being able to do this is the essence of good scalability. [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram) and [Disqus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus) are two Django based products that have millions of active users, this is taken as an example of the scalability of Django.

* **Portability :** All the codes of the Django framework are written in [Python](/wiki/Python), which runs on many platforms. Which leads to run Django too in many platforms such as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).

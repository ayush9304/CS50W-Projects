# Django

**Django** is a [Python](/wiki/Python)-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view (MVC) architectural pattern.
It is maintained by *Django Software Foundation* (DSF), an American independent organisation.

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.

###Why to choose Django?

* **Reassuringly secure : **Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.
* **Exceedingly scalable : **Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Djangoâ€™s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.

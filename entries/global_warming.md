# Global Warming

**Global Warming** is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s [climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_system). It is a major aspect of **climate change** which, in addition to rising global [surface temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record), also includes its effects, such as changes in [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation). While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.

[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change) (IPCC) concluded that "human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century". These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of major nations and are [not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change). The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the impact from [carbon dioxide](/wiki/co2) and [methane](/wiki/methane). [Fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel) burning is the principal source of these gases, with [agricultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture) emissions and [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) also playing significant roles. [Climate sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity) to these gases is affected by [feedbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback), such as loss of [snow cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo), increased [water vapour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), and melting [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost).

#### Observed temperature rise

Multiple independently produced instrumental datasets confirm that the 2009-2018 decade was 0.93 &#x2213; 0.07 &#x00B0;C (1.67 &#x2213; 0.13 &#x00B0;F) warmer than the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900). Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 &#x00B0;C (0.36 &#x00B0;F) per decade. Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased. Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the [Medieval Climate Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Climate_Anomaly) and the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), were not as synchronous as current warming, but may have reached temperatures as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions. There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum). However, the observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even [abrupt geophysical events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrupt_climate_change) that took place in Earth's history do not approach current rates.

[Climate proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)) records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution), so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century, when thermometer records began to provide global coverage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted the baseline reference period 1850-1900 as an approximation of pre-industrial global mean surface temperature.

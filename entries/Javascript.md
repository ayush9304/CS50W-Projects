#JavaScript
**JavaScript** often abbreviated as **JS** is a programming language that conforms to the [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and [multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](/wiki/CSS), JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web). JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application). The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) have a dedicated [JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) to execute it.

JavaScript can be used for [Client-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side) developments as well as [Server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like **Array**, **Date**, and **Math**, and a core set of language elements like **operators**, **control structures**, and **statements**.

* **Client-side :** It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as **mouse clicks**, **form input**, and **page navigation**. Use full libraries for the client-side are [AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS), [ReactJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)), [VueJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js) and so many others.
* **Server-side :** It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)). Like if the [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) extensions allow an application to communicate with a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is [node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).

####Features of JavaScript

According to a recent survey conducted by [**Stack Overflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow), JavaScript is the most popular language on earth.
With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)) and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript:

* JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
* Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
* Can handle date and time.
* Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
* No compiler needed.

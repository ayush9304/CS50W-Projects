# Python

**Python** is an interpreted, [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), general-purpose programming language. Created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the [ABC language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)). Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.

Python is used for:

* [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development)
* [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development)
* [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)
* [system scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language)

Some facts about Python Programming Language:

1. Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language).
2. Python allows programming in [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [Procedural paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming).
3. Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.
4. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook), [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram), [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox), [Uber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber)… etc.
5. The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:
	* [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
	* GUI Applications (like [Kivy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivy_(framework)), Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
	* Web frameworks like [Django](/wiki/Django) (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
	* Image processing (like [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV), Pillow)
	* Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
	* Test frameworks
	* Multimedia
	* Scientific computing
	* Text processing and many more..

# Git

**Git** is a [distributed version-control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) system for tracking changes in [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) during [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity), and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 2005 for development of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most [clientâ€“server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server) systems, every Git directory on every [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) is a full-fledged [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) version 2.

####What Git is about?

* Git is a [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) **distributed version control system** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
* Git relies on the **basis of distributed development** of a software where more than one developer may have access to the source code of a specific application and can modify changes to it which may be seen by other developers..
* Initially designed and developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) for [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) development in 2005.
* Every git working directory is **a full-fledged repository** with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.
* Git **allows a team of people to work together**, all using the same files. And it helps **the team cope up with the confusion** that tends to happen **when multiple people are editing the same files**.
